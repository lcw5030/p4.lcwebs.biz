Project 4

For my final project I wanted to incorporate project's 2 and 3 along with my passion for running. 

In project 2 I created a social networking site for runners that gave the ability to:
-Sign Up
-Login
-Create Profile
-Edit Profile
-Create Posts
-Follow Users

In project 3, I created a pace calculator. Here is a bit of background on the context of the pace calculator:
			Running has always been a passion of mine and I have always enjoyed working on improving race times.
            This application allows you to calculate both pace and time for various race distances. 
            A Personal Record also known as "PR" is the fastest pace/time a runner has for a particular distance.
            The distances I have included in this application are in miles. A 5k is 3.1 miles. A 10k is 6.2 miles. 
            A half marathon is 13.1 miles and a full marathon is 26.2 miles.
            I would also like to give credit to http://www.mredkj.com/javascript/pacecalc.asp since I used this as the foundation for my pace calculator functionality.
            I have only included functionality for calculating pace/time in miles. This api did not utilize jQuery and did not have error handling.
Pace Calculator Features:
			-User can only type numeric values in time and date
            -User can only input values 0-59 for minutes/seconds
            -User can only input 1-12 for month, 1-31 for day, 1900-2020 for year
            -Pace/time and race details clear when changing drop downs
            -I also added a PR certificate on the right hand side of the screen
        

In creating P4 I needed to add tables to account for the race events and storing all PR data for each user. This was a very challenging exercise for me in taking a javascript application that did not retain data to being one that is connected to the database to store values for each user.

By storing these PR values for each user, I also added the ability for a user to view their PR certificate on their profile.

Javascript:

Javascript is used for the pace calculator functionality to calculate the pace/time for the user. Also, javascript is used to place the data in the PR certificate.

I have really enjoyed working on this application and building upon what I have learned, but I do realize that there is an abundance of features I wanted to add, but due to some of the struggles I was having, I had to cut back on some. For instance, users cannot view the PR certificates of other users. I also wanted to include the ability to register for race events other users post.

While I was not able to complete these tasks for p4, I am very excited to continue to work on this site even after the course has ended. It was a wonderful class and I would certainly reccommend it to others!

Thanks!
